Capstone Project: CloudUploaderCLI
This is my clouduploaderCLI project. The script is used to upload local files to an existing AWS S3 bucket. The code checks if the local file/path exists and then checks access to the AWS S3 bucket.


To Do: Setup authentication to a new AWS user/account. This includes how to authenticate AWS with AWS CLI.
